Project Recipes 
Tt’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge i have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, i am going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time this project is just to build  HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
