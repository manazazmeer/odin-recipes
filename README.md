# odin-recipes
Tt’s time to put all of my HTML knowledge into practice. I am going to build a basic recipe website in this project.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time  because this project is just to build  HTML chops; anyway I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
